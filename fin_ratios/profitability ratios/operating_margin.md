# Operating Margin

**Operating Margin** = Operating Income/Net Sales

How effectively the company is generating profit & income from its sales.

Higher Inventory TurnOver -> Higher Sales -> Higher Operating Efficiency -> Higher Operating Income
Lower Inventory Roation -> Sluggish Sales -> Sluggish Operating Efficiency -> Lower Operating Income

The company is not able to operate effiectively to generate sales with its assets

FMCG companies have very low margins but their inventory turn over is exteremely high.
Pharma companies have very high margins but their inventory turn over is not so great.

You need to remember that the margin may vary differently for different products. For example, a Watch/Spectale frames will have higher margins compared
to a Shampoo or a Soap. The way the consumer purchases these items is completely different.
