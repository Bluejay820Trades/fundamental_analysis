# Interest Coverage

You have leverage ratios such as debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity. They only tell how much debt a company
has taken, but cannot really tell if the company has the ability to re-pay the debt. That is where interest coverage ratio
comes in.

Its a measure of solvency and how effectively it is able to service its debt

**Interest Coverage Ratio** = Operating Expenses (EBIT) / Interest Expenses

How many times over can the company pay its existing interest expenses with its current earnings

If the interest coverage is, let us say, 0.7. It means that company is highly leveraged and is barely able to pay its interest expenses

EBIT -> Earnings before interest and tax
