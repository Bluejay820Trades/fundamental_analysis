# Debt to Total Assets Ratio

How much asset is required to repay the debt. The lower the better.
To find out by how much the company has 'leveraged' its total assets to obtain debt, this ratio is useful. And can also 
help us know if the company is in a stable financial solvent situation.

**Debt to Total Assets** = Debt/Total Assets

If a company has higher debt/total-assets ratio, it tells if the company will be in a financially solvent stage or financially bust stage.

debt/total-assets of 0.1 means 10% of company's assets are leveraged. 90% of the company is still held by the share holders.

Tata Motors(0.4) & 3i Infotech(0.6) in FY19.
40% of assets are leveraged vs 60% of the assets were leveraged.
