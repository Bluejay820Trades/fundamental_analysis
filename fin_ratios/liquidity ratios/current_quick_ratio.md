# Practical Financial Ratios for Analysis

## Understanding Liquidity Ratio
In financial analysis, assessing a company's ability to fulfill its short-term obligations is crucial. Liquidity ratios provide valuable insights into a company's liquidity position.

One widely used liquidity ratio is the Current Ratio, calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities:

**Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

A higher current ratio indicates better liquidity. However, it's important to note that not all assets can be easily converted into cash. Take, for example, a telecommunications company whose current assets include long-term and fixed assets.

Current Assets can include:

Cash
Receivables (Cash and bank balances)
Inventory (which may take time to liquidate)
Due to the nature of these assets, they may not be quickly liquidated. Therefore, it's essential to consider additional sub-ratios to gain a comprehensive understanding.

For instance, let's consider the case of the airline industry during a period of intense competition. Airfares were significantly reduced, impacting companies like Jet Airways. The decrease in airfare revenue affected their current assets, as they still needed to meet their current obligations, such as employee salaries and airport payments.

## Assessing Quick Ratio

To further evaluate a company's liquidity position while excluding the impact of inventory, we can use the Quick Ratio:

**Quick Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

A Quick Ratio of 1 is generally considered normal, indicating a reasonably healthy ability to meet current liabilities. Ratios below 1 suggest a company may face challenges in paying off its current obligations promptly.

Understanding and analyzing these practical financial ratios provides valuable insights into a company's liquidity position and can aid in making informed decisions for investment and financial management purposes.
