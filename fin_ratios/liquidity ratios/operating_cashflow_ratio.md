# Operating Cash Flow Ratio

**Operating Cash Flow Ratio** = Operating Cash Flow/Current Liabilities

Cash that business generates from operating activities (Typical Biz Activites) to meet its current obligations.
That is called Operating Cash Flow.

Revenue -> Revenue from core operations (This is the main operating activity through which revenue is generated) + Revenue from other income (Interest on 
Investments, Re-sale of assets)

If you look at the IT companies, they have got healthy operating cash flows. (entire EBITDA is like operating cash flow.)

If you look at a Cement company, there the operating cash flows are not so great. Why ?
They have large CapEx (machineary), they need to invest in trucks, anti-pollution machines & finally they have the end product cement which is not very expensive compared to the capex. so, their margins are not very great.
You will find not find buyers who will pay you upfront, they will eventually pay.

If the business is not generating enough cash flows, then the companies may go for a short-term debt. And we will talk about these in the leverage ratios.

In terms of comparing two different companies, see what generates that cash flow etc.,
