# Valuation Ratios

This ratio determines if the stock is cheap or expensive as compared to the value or benefits it offers.

## PE Ratio

**PE Ratio** = Price per share/Earnings per share
Earnings per Share = Net Profit/Total No of Shares.


Given people's preference for high quality business, the stocks tend to get higher PE multiples.


## PB Ratio

Usually done for **banks.** or Engineering companines.

**PB Ratio** = Price per share (CMP)/ Book Value Per Share (BVPS)



## Enterprise Value Ratio

Enterprise Value(EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash

Enterprise Value Ratio = EV/EBITDA

EBITDA is available to service both the borrowers and equity. Mostly used in manufacturing industries.

Because it is capex heavy and there is depreciation of assets compared to service based companies. So, the EBIDTA will offer the right evaluation
rather than PE or PB and it can be used to compare the peers very effectively.

How many times you will have to pay the EBITDA in order to arrive at the Enterprise value of the company ?

if EV/EBITDA < 10 its a healthy company otherwise it is over-priced.
